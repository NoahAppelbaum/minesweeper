DO NOT have this be displayed based on context!

Later, I can do fancy things with pausing/unpausing the timer!

          Jocelyn Sweeper is a take on the classic game Minesweeper, featuring
          the queen of our household, Jocelyn Adelaide Neshelbaum, the Duchess
          McPiggen. All art is illustrated by my fabulous wife, Kelly Nesheim,
          and everything else was made by me,{" "}

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <div className="About-chunk">
        <p>
          The goal of the game is to uncover all of the delicious vegetables in
          the garden! But no tomatoes -- Jocelyn hates those!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="About-chunk">
        <p>
          Click/touch a square to reveal garden spaces. A number in a revealed
          space shows how many tomatoes are touching that square.

        <p>
          Right click or press-and-hold a space to mark it as a potential
          tomato. Use this to help you keep track!

        <p>
          If you click on a tomato, you lose! Try again, and see how fast you
          can find all those vegetables!
